		<h1>Voting Registration</h1>
    <p> By: Isabella Douglas </p>

	</header>

<p id="box"> This page breaks down Florida's voting registration into two categories. Florida's voter registration by party affiliation from 2017 to 2022 is shown in the first chart and Florida's voter registration by county and party for the top 10 most populated Florida counties as of Sept. 30, 2022 is shown in the second. The first chart shows the steaady lead the Republican party maintains against the other parties as well as indicates the very low voter registration minor parties have maintained over the years. In the second graph, to provide even more digestible data, readers can understand where the highest populated counties voted. All data and information on this page can be found on the Florida Division of Elections website.  </p>
